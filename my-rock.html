    <h2>BIO</h2>
    Willcock says he wrote the lyrics to four of the group’s songs in 1977 but never received proper credit. He also claims he co-wrote the song “Prodigal Son” with Harris. Iron Maiden didn’t release their first album until 1980 (with singer Paul Di’Anno).

    <h2>History</h2>

    Time has been great to the OLD timers. They are living the dream that others would have said were "Wasted Years".
